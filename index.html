        <h2>Passage 1: The Importance of Embeddings in AI</h2>
        <p>
            Embeddings are low-dimensional numerical representations designed to capture the meaning and relationships between various types of data, such as text, images, and audio. They simplify complex data into compact vectors that preserve semantic information, making it easier to process and compare. For example, in an embedding space, the word "king" might be closer to "queen" than to "bicycle," reflecting their semantic similarity. These embeddings are widely used in applications like search engines and recommendation systems, where they help identify patterns and similarities in data.

        <h2>Passage 2: Applications of Embeddings</h2>
        <p>
            Embeddings play a crucial role in retrieval systems like Google Search. By converting both user queries and web pages into embeddings, search engines can find semantically similar content efficiently. Similarly, recommendation systems use embeddings to suggest items that align with user preferences. Joint embeddings take this further by mapping different types of data, such as text and images, into the same space, enabling cross-modal comparisons.

        <h2>Passage 4: Text Embeddings</h2>
        <p>
            Text embeddings represent words, sentences, or documents as dense numerical vectors that capture semantic relationships. Tokenization is the first step in generating text embeddings, breaking down text into smaller units called tokens. Early techniques like Word2Vec revolutionized this field by creating word embeddings that reflect semantic similarities between words.
